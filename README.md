The University Learning Management System is a complete, fully functional, and responsive web application developed using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript. It simulates the core academic operations of a university by providing three separate portals for Admins, Teachers, and Students. Each portal is designed to support the specific tasks of its user type. Admins can oversee system data and manage user accounts, Teachers can mark attendance, upload results, and review class information, and Students can view their attendance, marks, and academic progress. All data interactions, including user login validation, attendance updates, and result calculations, are handled entirely on the client side using browser local storage, ensuring that the system functions smoothly without any backend server.

The project follows a complete software engineering workflow beginning with high-fidelity UI/UX design. All screens were designed in Figma with pixel-perfect mockups and an interactive, clickable prototype demonstrating full user flows from login to task completion. The design process also included a detailed style guide defining the color palette, typography, and reusable components, ensuring visual consistency across all pages. The application strictly follows the Three-Tier Client-Side Architecture, where HTML and CSS form the presentation layer, modular JavaScript acts as the logic layer, and local storage serves as the data layer. This structure helps maintain clear separation of concerns, improves readability, and aligns fully with the required architectural design principles.

The implementation phase uses clean, modular, and maintainable code. All JavaScript logic is divided into separate files, such as authentication handling, local storage management, and UI updates, ensuring that the application remains organized and scalable. No inline CSS or inline JavaScript is used, and all styles and scripts are external and well-structured. The repository also includes a meaningful commit history that reflects consistent contributions and professional development practices throughout the project’s lifecycle.

Testing was carried out using a structured test case table that includes both positive and negative scenarios for key features such as login validation, attendance marking, result uploading, and data retrieval. Each test case documents the steps, expected result, actual result, and final pass or fail status to ensure the application behaves correctly and reliably. The project concludes with complete deployment on GitHub Pages, making the system fully accessible as a live web application. Users can run the project locally by simply opening the index.html file in any modern browser, without requiring additional setup or configuration.

This repository represents the complete lifecycle of a professionally executed academic management system, including design, architecture, implementation, testing, and deployment. It reflects a strong emphasis on code clarity, UI consistency, modular structure, and adherence to formal software engineering standards.
